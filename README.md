# Naive-Bayes-with-Front-End
The following is an implementation of the Naive Bayes theorem on a dataset, with a front end built using the Stream Lit library.
•	In this code we have used python language as a base and using different libraries to help accomplish this task.
•	The Stream Lit library was used to make a webpage where we have added a title, a sub header, a text input slot, a button that starts the classification process.
•	Using the panda’s library to help import the dataset into the environment.
•	Using sklearn library to import features that help implement the Naïve Bayes Algorithm.
•	The code also predicts the sentiment of a review entered by the user and prints the accuracy score and the confusion matrix of the dataset involved.
•	The code is run through a command on the terminal i.e.,
streamlit run NameofFile.py
